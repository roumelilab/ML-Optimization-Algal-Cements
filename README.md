# ML-Optimization-Algal-Cements
This code is used in the manuscript titled "Closed-loop optimization using machine learning for the accelerated design of sustainable cements incorporating algal biomatter", authored by Meng-Yen Lin, Kristen Severson, Paul Grandgeorge, and Eleftheria
Roumeli

This folder contains the code that was developed for the modeling and closed loop testing.

`agp.py` contains the code to specify an amortized Gaussian process model and `model_utils.py` contains some supporting functions to use the trained model to make predictions from the prior and posterior.

`closed_loop_utils.py` contains the code to run the closed loop experimentation as well as the simulator.
